## About Me

I am a Computer Science undergraduate at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, where I focus on machine learning and deep learning. My current projects explore how these technologies can be applied to image recognition and generative models.

I enjoy experimenting with new ideas, learning through hands-on projects, and contributing to open-source communities.

## Projects

### 1. [VAE/CVAE Latent Space Visualization](https://github.com/erfan-mahdavi/vae-cvae-project)
This project explores latent space representation by comparing  VAE and Conditional VAE models on the MNIST dataset. The focus is on generating image resembling mnist, visualizing and analyzing the difference in class separations within the latent spaces.

- **Technologies:** PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib ,torchvision
- **Objective:** Explore latent space distributions of generative models.
- **Highlights:** Clear visualization and comparison of latent spaces for better insight into class separations.


### 2. [Tomato/Apple Recognizer](https://github.com/erfan-mahdavi/tomato-apple-recognizer)
A machine learning model that differentiates between apples and tomatoes using image classification techniques. The project uses a simple implementation of neaural networks with custom cost function and back prapogation, trained on a custom dataset.

- **Technologies:**  scipy,matplot,numpy
- **Objective:** Build an accurate model for fruit recognition.
- **Highlights:** Achieved over 80% accuracy on test data after fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters.


### 3. [snake_game](https://github.com/erfan-mahdavi/snake_game)
I developed a snake game in C++ that challenges players to navigate their snake, represented by @, while competing against a random moving snake, %. Players must avoid walls, eat food to grow, and strategize against the enemy snake. The game features two types of food: X adds 1 to the snake's length, while $ adds 3. The game's competitive twist includes battles where larger snakes can consume the enemy, but if two snake heads collide, both die.

- **Technologies:**  c++
- **Objective:** Build a snake game
- **Highlights:** Achieved implementation with intented rules.
